# Assignment 2

This repository contains my Assignment 2 for the course SOFTENG 281: Object-Oriented Programming in Semester 1 2023. All code implementation within the /main folder except for Main.java, MessageCli.java and Utils.java was created by me.

This project was to implement the traditional Italian hand game Morra. In it we implemented Factory design pattern to generate AI opponents and leveraged the Strategy design pattern to control their evolving strategies.
